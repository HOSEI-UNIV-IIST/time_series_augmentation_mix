# Accuracy Analysis of Techniques Across Multiple Datasets

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the performance of various techniques applied to multiple datasets in terms of accuracy. The primary goal is to categorize these techniques into meaningful groups and extract insights by comparing their performance across different datasets.

## Why This Project?

When dealing with a variety of data transformation and processing techniques, itâ€™s essential to evaluate their effectiveness across different datasets. By grouping techniques based on their approach (e.g., sequential, parallel, time-based, etc.), we can gain deeper insights into:
- Which techniques are most effective for specific datasets?
- How do different methodological groups compare in terms of accuracy?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of each technique group?

This project aims to provide a clear visual and analytical understanding of these questions.

## Project Goals

1. **Categorization of Techniques:** Group techniques based on their methodological similarities, such as sequential processing, parallel processing, time-based transformations, and magnitude-based transformations.

2. **Performance Evaluation:** Compare the accuracy of each technique across multiple datasets, allowing for an in-depth understanding of their effectiveness.

3. **Visualization:** Provide meaningful visualizations that highlight the distribution and variance of accuracies for each technique group across datasets.

4. **Insight Extraction:** Derive actionable insights regarding which techniques or groups are most suitable for certain types of datasets.

## Methodology

### Technique Grouping

Techniques are grouped into the following categories:
1. **Sequential Methods:** Techniques applied sequentially.
2. **Parallel Methods:** Techniques applied in parallel.
3. **Transformation-based Methods:** Techniques involving data transformations like jitter, scaling, etc.
4. **Time-based Methods:** Techniques focusing on time-related manipulations.
5. **Magnitude-based Methods:** Techniques focusing on magnitude-related manipulations.

### Datasets

The following datasets are used for the analysis:
- **CBF**
- **ECG200**
- **ECG5000**
- **FordB**
- **GunPointAgeSpan**
- **Strawberry**
- **Yoga**

### Visualization Approach

For each dataset, the accuracies of techniques are visualized using violin plots, grouped by technique categories. This approach highlights the distribution of accuracy values and provides a comparative view of technique performance within and across categories.

## Key Insights

1. **Technique Effectiveness:** The violin plots reveal which technique groups consistently perform well across datasets, helping to identify the most reliable methods.
2. **Group Comparisons:** By comparing groups like sequential and parallel methods, we can observe which processing approach is generally more effective.
3. **Dataset Specificity:** Certain techniques may perform better on specific datasets, offering guidance on selecting the right technique based on dataset characteristics.

## Future Work

1. **Expand Dataset Range:** Incorporate additional datasets to broaden the analysis.
2. **Technique Refinement:** Introduce more nuanced technique variations to further refine performance insights.
3. **Advanced Visualization:** Explore other visualization techniques like heatmaps and radar charts to present the data more effectively.
